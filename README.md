# CaptainsMistress

This is the game "Captain's Mistress", also known as "Connect Four" (which is a
registered trademark of The Milton Bradley Company). For more information see

## To Play

This is a console game, so there are MANY ways to open the game.  I made a convenient 'playgame.rb' file which I find easiest.  Simply type the following into the console to begin the game:
